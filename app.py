Flame Shot Exporter.

This app takes a sequence in Flame and generates lots of Shotgun related content.
It is similar to the Hiero exporter. The following items are generated:

- New Shots in Shotgun, with tasks
- Cut information in Shotgun
- New versions (with uploaded quicktimes) for all segments
- Plates on disk for each segment
- Batch files for each shot
- Clip xml files for shots and clips.

The exporter is effectively a wrapper around the Flame custom export process 
with some bindings to Shotgun.

This app implements two different sets of callbacks - both utilizing the same 
configuration and essentially parts of the same workflow (this is why they are not
split across two different apps).

- The Flame Shot export runs via a context menu item on the sequence right-click menu
- A Flare / batch mode render hook allows Shotgun to intercept the rendering process and
  ask the user if they want to submit to Shotgun review whenever they render out in Flame.
